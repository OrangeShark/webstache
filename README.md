webstache
=========
webstache is a command line program which generates static webpages using mustache templates and json data files as input. Typing into the command line 
```bash
webstache directory/to/input/files
```
will create a directory called output with the generated HTML pages.

For any file which does not need to be generated, like JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets, can be put into a directory named static in the input directory. They will be copied over into the root of the output directory.

This program is used as an example project for the FIU's Panther Linux User Group's Python workshop.
