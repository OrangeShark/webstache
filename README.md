webstache
=========
webstache is a command line program which generates static webpages using mustache templates and json data files as input. Typing into the command line 
'''bash
webstache directory/to/input/files
'''
will create a directory called website with the generated HTML pages.

This program is used as an example project for the FIU's Panther Linux User Group's Python workshop.
